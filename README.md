# Unique-Bank
This repository houses a comprehensive data analysis project focused on deriving actionable intelligence from a bank's core operational and customer datasets. Leveraging Microsoft Power BI for dynamic visualization and reporting, this analysis provides a clear view of product profitability, channel-specific risk exposure, and key regional transaction drivers.

The primary objective is to equip business stakeholders with detailed metrics on financial health and customer behavior to inform strategic decision-making in product development, security protocols, and market targeting.

📊 Key Analytical Findings

The interactive Power BI dashboard is structured to deliver four core analytical perspectives:

1. Product Interest Rate Profiling

Analysis of average interest rates across major product categories (Credit, Loan, Investments, and Deposit).

Key Finding: Credit products exhibit the highest average interest rate, confirming their status as a primary revenue stream. Conversely, Deposit accounts register the least average interest rate, reflecting the bank's cost of funds.

2. Fraudulent Transaction Channel Audit

Quantification of the total number of fraudulent transactions segmented by channel (Web, Mobile, ATM, and Branch).

Key Finding: The Web channel accounts for the overwhelming majority of fraudulent transactions, while the Branch channel demonstrates the lowest risk exposure.

Implication: This mandates an urgent review and enhancement of web-based security measures.

3. Geographic Transaction Volume Analysis

Comparison of total transaction volume across key metropolitan areas.

Key Finding: Lagos stands out as the highest transaction driver (20,000 transactions), while Abuja records the lowest volume (13,000 transactions).

Implication: Future resource allocation, including ATM deployment and branch staff optimization, should be aligned with these regional performance metrics.

4. Income-Transaction Correlation by Occupation

Exploration of the relationship between customers' average annual income and their total transaction amount, segmented by occupation.

Key Finding: A clear, positive correlation exists between average annual income and total transaction value across most occupations.

Outlier Observation: One distinct occupational category(Teacher) was identified as a significant outlier, demonstrating transaction behavior that deviates from the expected income-to-transaction relationship. This requires dedicated exploratory analysis.
